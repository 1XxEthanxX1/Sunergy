              How a Sunergy Solar Solution can save you money Thanks to falling
              costs of solar and our super-efficient solar panels, using solar
              energy is more affordable than ever. For an average home, the cost
              of a solar panel is around $10,000 installed. We have wonderful
              finance options available to help you meet this initial cost. Most
              homes will be able to save 45-50% on their electricity bill each
              month with a solar panel. Think of what the savings will be for
              you! The graph which follows shows a typical situation where a
              family pays for their solar solution using a finance option. It
              shows the accumulated costs and profits of the system over a 20
              year period. It is clear that if you are planning to stay in your
              home for ten or more years, the accumulated profit made on your
              investment is huge. Over 20 years you could save a total of
              $32,850 on your power bills! <br />

              How a Sunergy Solar Solution helps to save the environment We love
              our planet just as much as you do. That’s why Sunergy produces
              Earth-friendly technology that generates power in a sustainable
              way. Most electricity is currently generated using fossil fuels
              like coal and oil. There are two problems with this: First one is
              that fossil fuel supplies are limited and running out fast.
              Secondly. using these fossil fuels to generate power builds up
              greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Solar power is different: the
              first difference is that unlike fossil fuels, solar power relies
              on a power source that is not going to run out any time soon: the
              Sun! Second difference is using solar power technology to generate
              power does not result in the emission of any greenhouse gases.
              What’s more, Sunergy’s optimised solar panels are designed and
              manufactured in a way which ensures the smallest possible impact
              on the environment.<br /><a
